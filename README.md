# California Housing Regression Assignment

## Objective
This project evaluates different regression models on the California Housing dataset to predict median house values using various supervised learning techniques.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared Score (RÂ²)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open `regression_assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells

## Dataset
The dataset is loaded directly from `sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing`.
